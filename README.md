# Practical Python: A Hands-On Learning Journey (Work in progress)

## Course Overview
This course teaches Python through practical, real-world examples. You'll learn fundamental concepts while building small, useful applications. Rather than overwhelming you with theory, we'll focus on learning by doing, with short code examples that guide your understanding rather than providing complete solutions.

## Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with programming concepts
- Python 3.8+ installed on your computer
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended for beginners)
- Willingness to experiment and write code yourself!

## Course Structure

### Part 1: Python Fundamentals Refresher
- **Module 1.1:** Variables, Data Types, and Basic Operations
- **Module 1.2:** Control Flow (if/else, loops)
- **Module 1.3:** Functions and Scope
- **Module 1.4:** Working with Standard Data Structures
- **Project:** Command-line Calculator

### Part 2: Object-Oriented Programming with Python
- **Module 2.1:** Introduction to Classes and Objects
- **Module 2.2:** Methods, Attributes, and Encapsulation
- **Module 2.3:** Inheritance and Polymorphism
- **Module 2.4:** Building Class Hierarchies
- **Project:** Simple Library Management System

### Part 3: Functional Programming Concepts
- **Module 3.1:** Functions as First-Class Objects
- **Module 3.2:** Lambda Functions and Higher-Order Functions
- **Module 3.3:** Callbacks and Event-Driven Programming
- **Module 3.4:** Decorators and Function Wrappers
- **Project:** Task Scheduler with Callbacks

### Part 4: Introduction to Asynchronous Programming
- **Module 4.1:** Understanding Synchronous vs Asynchronous
- **Module 4.2:** Python's `asyncio` Library
- **Module 4.3:** Async/Await Syntax
- **Module 4.4:** Practical Async Patterns
- **Project:** Asynchronous Web Scraper

### Part 5: Capstone Project
- **Module 5.1:** Requirements and Planning
- **Module 5.2:** Architecture and Design
- **Module 5.3:** Implementation
- **Module 5.4:** Testing and Refinement
- **Project:** To-Do Application with CLI and File Storage

## Teaching Methodology
Each module follows a consistent pattern:
1. **Concept Introduction:** Clear explanations of key concepts
2. **Guided Examples:** Short code snippets demonstrating the concepts
3. **Challenges:** Small coding tasks to apply what you've learned
4. **Solution Hints:** Guidance without giving away complete solutions
5. **Practice Exercise:** A slightly larger exercise to reinforce learning

## How to Use This Course
- Work through the modules in order
- Type out all code examples yourself (don't copy/paste!)
- Complete all challenges before looking at hints
- Take time to experiment with the code
- Build the projects incrementally as you learn

Happy coding!
